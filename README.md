# C Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of C programming and aims to enhance my skills and understanding of the language.

## Projects:

- **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations. It takes user input for two numbers and an operator, and displays the result.

- **Prime Number Checker**: This project checks if a given number is prime or not. It accepts an integer input and provides the result.

- **Factorial Calculator**: A program to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. It uses a recursive approach to find the factorial value.

- **Temperature Converter**: A simple utility to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users can input a temperature value, and the program will display the converted value.

- **Text File Reader**: This project reads a text file and displays its contents on the console. It demonstrates file handling in C.

- **Matrix Operations**: A set of functions to perform basic matrix operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.

- **Stack Implementation**: An implementation of a stack data structure using an array. It includes functions for push, pop, and displaying the stack.

- **Queue Implementation**: Similar to the stack, this project implements a queue data structure using an array. It provides functions for enqueue, dequeue, and displaying the queue.

- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary search tree (BST) implementation in C. It includes functions for inserting, searching, and deleting nodes in the BST.

- **Linked List**: A linked list data structure implementation. It demonstrates the creation, traversal, and manipulation of linked lists.

- **Bubble Sort**: An implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in C. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

- **Merge Sort**: Another sorting algorithm, merge sort, is implemented here. It sorts an array by dividing it into smaller subarrays and merging them back together.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm, BFS, is implemented to traverse and explore a graph.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Similar to BFS, this project implements the DFS algorithm for graph traversal.

- **Tower of Hanoi**: A recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a classic problem in computer science.

- **8 Queens Puzzle**: An implementation to solve the 8 Queens puzzle, where the goal is to place 8 chess queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/water-may/C-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd C-projects
   ```

3. Each project has its own directory with source code and any necessary files. Compile and run the programs using a C compiler.
